# Dictionary 
# Data type but also a data structure
# Unlike list it has key - value pairs, it's the same as Objects in Javascript

example = {
    "a": [1, 2, 3],
    "b": "Hello there",
    "c": True
}

# Keys - Can be any data type that is immutable, has to be unique

example2 = {
    123: [1, 2, 3],
    True: "Hello there",
    None: False
}
